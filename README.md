# CloudKitchen

This project was built during Web Technologies course

In this system, there are four types of users - Admin, Customer, Rider, and Kitchen Manager. We have maintained simplicity while developing this system as a static 
website and tried to make this project user friendly as much as possible.

Here, each of the users can register and login to the system. And every user has their own functionalities such as- ‘Customer’ can see the menu and choose food, time 
and location of his choice and can place order to the system. ‘Customer’ can also pre-order food of his choice. The order which is placed by the ‘Customer’ will pop to
the ‘Rider’ and the ‘Rider’ can accept the order and will request for confirmation to the ‘Kitchen Manager’. The ‘Customer’ can also see the order details. ‘Kitchen
Manager’ analyzes the food and food preparation time, and inform to the ‘Rider’. After getting confirmation from ‘Kitchen Manager’, ‘Rider’ sends confirmation to the 
‘Customer’ and take the food for delivery. When the food has been prepared, ‘kitchen Manager’ handovers the food to the ‘Rider’ and he delivers the ordered food to the
‘Customer’. The ‘Customer’ after receiving the order, can do payment by cash, or by card, or by mobile banking. If ‘Customer’ faces any problem, he can directly report
to the ‘Admin’. ‘Rider’ only receives the cash payment; other two types of payment directly go to the account of ‘Admin’. Mainly, the ‘Admin’supervises the whole 
system, such as can see and manipulate other users’ information and can make changes in the menu such as add, delete or edit items. Moreover, ‘Admin’ distributes the 
payment to ‘Rider’ and ‘Kitchen Manager’, solves the problem reported by the ‘Customer’ and sends feedback to them.
