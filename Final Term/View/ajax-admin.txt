Staff who are feeling unwell should not report to work and should seek medical advice.
However, in the event that a food worker becomes unwell in the workplace with typical
symptoms of COVID-19, they should be removed to an area away from other people. 
If possible, find a room or area where they can be isolated behind a closed door, 
such as a staff office. If it is possible to open a window, do so for ventilation. 
Arrangements should be made for the unwell employee to be removed quickly from the food premise.
